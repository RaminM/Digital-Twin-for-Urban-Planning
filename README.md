In this project, digital twin of ˚Alesund has been developed and utilized for planning the location for the construction of new infrastructures in the city. The parameters that were used for the assessment of the locations consist of, walkability, energy consumption, accessibility, and visibility. A total weighted score for each location is calculated based on the user’s preferences. A case study for building a new hospital in the city has been done using the developed tool and the best location was selected based on the desired criteria.
